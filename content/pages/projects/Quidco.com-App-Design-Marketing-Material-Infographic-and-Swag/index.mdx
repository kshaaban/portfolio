During my time as a Digital Designer with [Quidco.com](https://quidco.com), I assisted the Head of Design in designing panels for the Quidco.com app. The app, which was used by a large number of the 3 million Quidco.com members was continually updated to include new features. The Quidco.com app was featured on Econsultancy.com as an ['example of mobile marketing excellence'](https://econsultancy.com/blog/62128-six-examples-of-mobile-marketing-excellence/).
